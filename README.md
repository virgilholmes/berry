# Polar, a flash player

## So, how does it work?
Polar runs a older version of Electron that supports the PepperFlashPlayer. This means all flash apps and websites will work with Polar. 

## When it is going to come out?
Currently, We don't have a launch date. It is a Work in Progess.

## How do I help?
Polar is in a closed development. When we are ready to release, It will be open source.
